1.	Steps to upload a file on github

Git init
Git remote add origin <url.git> (connect to remote repository)
Git pull origin main (download files)
Git add <file name>
Git commit -m “message”
Git push origin main (upload)

2.	How to delete a file

# Remove the file from the working directory
git rm filename

# Commit the deletion
git commit -m "Remove filename"

# Push the changes to GitHub
git push origin branch_name

Replace "filename" with the actual name of the file you want to delete, and "branch_name" with the name of the branch you are working on (e.g., "main" or "master").
