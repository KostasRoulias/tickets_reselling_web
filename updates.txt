Οι αλλαγές μου:
- Άλλαξα τα sections "Latest News" και "Albums" αλλά διατήρησα τα id και classes του για να μην υπάρξει
  πρόβλημα στο css κλπ:

  - Άλλαξα background colour ώστε να είναι ένα gradient colour από magenda σε dark blue και transition from top to bottom

  - Added "Hot Events":
    - Coldplay Event 
    - Athens International Film Festival (AIFF)
    - Food Expo

  - Filled each "hot event" with information about them and also used "&nbsp;" to move the type of each event more to the right

  - Changed font color to yellow-ish for better visibility

  - Changed pictures on the "Albums" Section

  - Changed content on albums to make it more enthusiastic and ticket/entertainment-oriented

- Changed footer on all .html files so that it shows the correct info (correct email, name, etc) also moved the "Contact Us" section
  more to the left because the email was very close with the "Get in Touch" seciton

- Changed all Rights Reserved text on the very bottom on all .html files, into All Right Reserved .helloWorld Solutions
